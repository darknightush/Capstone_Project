## A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.For example, you want to sell a house and you donít know the price which you can take ó it canít be too low or too high. To find house price you usually try to find similar properties in your neighbourhoodand based on gathered data you will try to assess your house price.
